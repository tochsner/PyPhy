# PyPhy: A Python package to specify phylogenetic models

This package allows to specify phylogenetic models in python and to convert them into the JSON interchange format [Codephy](https://github.com/CODEPhylo/codephy).

## Key features

- Allows specification of models using a familiar Python syntax, including functions, if-then-else statements, and for-loops.
- Excellent tooling support (autocompletion, static type checking, etc.) thanks to a fully-typed interface.

## Getting started

- Python 3.13 is required (we use modern type hints features like recursive type aliases).
- We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
- Install dependencies with `poetry install`.
- Run the example with `poetry run python example.py`.
